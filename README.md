A simple websites crawler is performed based on https:\\oilprice.com. The crawling is done for all unique (non-repetitive) links from this site. All texts are analyzed for two metrics: a notation frequency for all major (oil relative) countries (100+ countries are used) and the mutual notation of countries in documents.

The first metrics (notation) should show which of countries has biggest impact on oil price at the current time.

The second metrics (mutual notation) shows which relationships affect. For example Russia-Ukraine is shows as a big impact (political conflict) and Russia-China (commercial deals)
